# Computational Chemistry Applied to Materials: Binder Lab

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jackevansadl/CCM2/HEAD)

This is a repository designed to be used by [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). It builds openMM in a Docker image, so that users can 
use these libraries in a reproducible, platform-indpendent Jupyter environment. Intended for CHEM3208 2022 at ANU.
